Beatbox is a Discord-based music app where you can enjoy music together with friends without ads.
Its inspiration was derived from another project I did during covid lockdowns (Pulse Bot) where my only escape was the
extent of my creativity. Today, it serves as a passion project to explore new technologies and further refine my skills
and abilities as a programmer as I grow. With that being said, it may not be the most feature-packed app, 
but it does have some hidden gems for you developers out there.

## Specs

- JVM: OpenJDK-21
