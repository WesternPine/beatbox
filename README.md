Beatbox is a Discord-based music app where you can enjoy music together with friends.

Its inspiration was derived from another project I did during covid lockdowns (Pulse Bot) where my only escape was the
extent of my creativity. Today, it serves as proof of programming capability and a base project with a simplistic design that can be expanded upon
for other development projects.

## Notes

This project has been replicated in so many different ways, this was just my personal twist on how I would start something like this.

I don't feel the desire to pursue creating a fully featured bot that will inevitably be removed by DMCA, 
so instead this is a shell/base project that can be used by developers to start their own project to learn about things like
reflections, dependency injection, APIs, build systems, pipelines, and streams. 
It covers a broad range of both beginning and advanced topics that all programmers should cover in their careers at least once.
